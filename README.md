The urine hit the head early
  <p>At 4, he actively swore with obscenities; in kindergarten</p>
  <p>The girls showed me their pussy for the first time</p>
  <p>Then school, smelly uniforms, fights, glue</p>
  <p>So I became stronger</p>
  <p>Stealing money in the locker room</p>
  <p>At 8 I started smoking, at 11 I threw the first stick</p>
  <p>He gave up on his parents, began to disappear with friends in a landfill</p>
  <p>Kirzachi and telaga, Brezhnev died, began to go into the rocking chair</p>

  <p>I found it, I was fucked up by Vitka and Kolya</p>
  <p>Linoleum, blood stains, put on the register.</p> </a>
