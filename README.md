# hello-world

<a href="https://genius.com/Krovostok-biography-lyrics">I was born in Moscow in the 70th on the edge of the city
The urine hit the head early
At 4, he actively swore with obscenities; in kindergarten
The girls showed me their pussy for the first time
Then school, smelly uniforms, fights, glue
So I became stronger
Stealing money in the locker room
At 8 I started smoking, at 11 I threw the first stick
He gave up on his parents, began to disappear with friends in a landfill
Kirzachi and telaga, Brezhnev died, began to go into the rocking chair
I bought boxing gloves, they were stolen at school
I found it, I was fucked up by Vitka and Kolya
Linoleum, blood stains, put on the register.

Was born on the Russian soil under Russian sky.
